<pre><code>Good evening, everyone. On behalf of the bride and groom, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to

or Kristen's life. Today, together, we witness the beginning of their lives together as

<li><p>Wedding Vows</p>

<pre><code>    Weddings tend to be full of pomp and circumstance, and eloquent readings or songs that have
    attached sentiment. I've always felt these portions are for display; more for the audience
    than the bride and groom. However, the vows are commitments made between the bride and
    groom alone.
</code></pre>

<p><em>To Andy</em></p>

<pre><code>    Do you Andrew promise to love Kristen freely - without restrictions; 
    honestly - without deceit; now - without hesitation?
    "I do." 
    --
    Do you promise to accept her just as she is, sharing with her and supporting her through the 
    experiences of your lives, be they easy or difficult, happy or sad, challenging or mundane, 
    till death do you part?
    "I do."
</code></pre>

<p><em>To Kristen</em></p>

<pre><code>    Do you Kristen promise to love Andrew freely - without restrictions; 
    honestly - without deceit; now - without hesitation?
    "I do."
    --
    Do you promise to accept him just as he is, sharing with him and supporting him through the 
    experiences of your lives, be they easy or difficult, happy or sad, challenging or mundane, 
    till death do you part?
    "I do."
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Community's declaration of consent.</p>

<pre><code>    A marriage needs the support of a community. Will you, Kristen and Andrew's friends and family,
    promise to support them in their marriage, loving them, and encouraging their love for each other?
    (guests respond, "We will").
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Exchange of the Rings</p>

<pre><code>    Kristen and Andrew, may these rings be forever a reminder of the vows you have made today.
    --
    Andrew please place this ring upon Kristen's finger and repeat after me
    --
    This ring I give to you as a token of my love and devotion. I pledge to you all 
    that I am and all that I will ever be. With this ring, I gladly marry you
    and join my life to yours.
    --
